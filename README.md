# Hi there 👋  

I'm Paul, a Master's student in financial engineering at **EPFL**. I've worked on projects in **Machine Learning, Data Science, and Quantitative Finance**.  
Here are some of the them that I’ve worked on:

## 📂 Selected Projects  

- [**International Portfolio Diversification**](https://github.com/mulemule02/investments_project)  
  *Analyzed stock indices & currencies, built risk-parity and mean-variance portfolios, implemented momentum, reversal, and carry strategies.*  

- [**ML Project 2 – Swiss AI Initiative**]  
  *Developed monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana, aggregated GitHub contributions, and contributed to Swiss AI LLM documentation & GUI. Repositery is private.*  

- [**ML Project 1 – Feature Engineering & PCA**]  
  *Predicted heart disease risk using PCA, logistic regression, and feature engineering with custom evaluation metrics. EPFL repositery so it is private*  

- [**Machine Learning for Finance (FIN-407)**](https://github.com/mirkorado/ML-Project)  
  *Developed a deep neural network (ResidualMLP) to predict daily stock returns, engineered financial features from firm-level data, implemented multiple loss functions (Sharpe ratio optimization, regularized softmax, top-k selection), and analyzed portfolio performance over long-term datasets.*
